# PixelSketch!
### PixelSketch is a simple project I made to practice manipulating the DOM.
The idea for this project originally came from one of the beginner courses of [TOP](https://github.com/TheOdinProject).<br />For the color picker feature, I used the lightweight [Coloris library](https://github.com/mdbassit/Coloris).<br />
